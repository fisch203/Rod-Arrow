<h2>
Rod and Arrow is a group of hunting and fishing enthusiasts from Mid-Michigan.</h2>
<p>
We are interested in providing a convenient place for fellow enthusiasts </br>
to view educational and entertaining videos ranging from GoPro field footage </br>
to instructional videos on cooking and cleaning your catch. We will share videos </br>
from YouTube and other video sites that we find interesting and/or informative. </br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
Soon, we will begin releasing original video content including footage from </br>
Daniel's bear hunting trip to Alaska, Matt's Muskie trips on Lake St Claire </br>
and Alex in the kitchen preparing what they bring back.
